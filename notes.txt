TI 84 Compiler Notes :

Goal :
Create a compiler for a TI 84.
There already exists a C compiler for a TI 84...
What makes my compiler different/What's the point of this project?
Well, I want to learn about compilers and programming languages.
As well, as low level computing and machine code.
In order to pull this off, I will need to hone my understanding of the
TI-84 OS. 

I think a future goal for this project would be to create my own low level 
language... and then a higher level langauge on top of that for the TI-84.

For example, making a functional language for the TI-84.
This would separate my compiler from the current C compiler.

Roadblocks :
My current roadblocks include data types and arithmetic...
Particularly for floating point numbers.
